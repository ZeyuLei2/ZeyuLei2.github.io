Hi! Iâ€™m an undergraduate student from [College of Computer Science](https://cs.scu.edu.cn/), [Sichuan University(SCU)](https://www.scu.edu.cn/), majoring in Computer Science & Technology (Top-notch Program, Wu Yuzhang Honors College). Currently, I am an exchange student at [Department of Computer and Information Science](https://www.cis.um.edu.mo/), [University of Macau](https://www.um.edu.mo/). I am gratefully advised by Prof. [Jizhe Zhou](https://knightzjz.github.io/) as a research intern.

# Research Experience
## IMDL-BenCo: A Comprehensive Benchmark and Codebase for Image Manipulation Detection & Localization *(Accepted as Spotlight at NeurIPS2024)*

Collaborated with the team to propose IMDL-BenCo, the first comprehensive Image Manipulation Detection & Localization (IMDL) benchmark and modular codebase as a co-first author, under the supervision of Prof. [Chi Man PUN](https://cmpun.github.io/) from University of Macau and Prof. [Jizhe Zhou](https://knightzjz.github.io/) from Sichuan University. I was responsible for the overall design of the code structure and refactoring existing IMDL models to align with the framework.

## Visual Prompting on Multimodal LLM for Fine-Grained Recognition  

Drawing from the strong detailed perception capability of Multimodal Large Language Models(MLLM), the team proposed an innovative visual prompt tuning technique to enhance Fine-Grained Recognition tasks, under the supervision of Prof. [Jizhe Zhou](https://knightzjz.github.io/). I was the team leader responsible for the model design and code implementation.

## NUS SoC Summer Workshop First Prize

In National University of Singapore School of Computing Summer Workshop, worked with two teammates to create the group project Real-Time Ray Tracing on GPU under the supervision of Prof. [Low Kok Lim](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~lowkl/). The team rendered a visually stunning and imaginative dynamic artifact model in real-time, ultimately winning first prize at the project showcase. I was responsible for the aesthetic design and code implementation.
